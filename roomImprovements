                    Features List
=========================================================
- AvSwitch:  This removes the floating avatar changer into an "Avatar" link where "From" was listed.  You can hover over the link to see your current avatar, click to change it.

- SendButton:  A little improvement on the "Talk/Listen" button.  Now you can see who you're sending to, as a little reminder before you hit the button!  It retains the name, even, after you send, or when you choose from the dropdown list or manually type in the name.

- RemoveUndo:  Finally, remove that pesky Undo link!  The downfall of nearly everybody at least once, now you don't have to worry!

- hiThere: Put in a nice little message welcoming the
viewer by name.

- fakeEditor: By popular demand, inserts an unobtrusive editor Menu so you can add images, links, simple HTML formatting, room links, and a preview function so you can see what your post looks like before you submit it!

- fixedImgSize: Make posted images a max width, so it doesn't blow out your room.

- dropDownFav: Your favorite links in a dropdown instead of a lengthy list of favorites!

- trueMulti: This is for multi-location rooms that veronica{Withheld} has designed.  It will not work with the general multiloc script.

- alternateWhisper: This is to turn on/off the alternate whisper styling.
